## üîê Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security

#### Input Validation
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Validate all inputs
import { body, validationResult } from 'express-validator';

router.post('/reviews', [
  body('rating').isInt({ min: 1, max: 5 }),
  body('comment').isLength({ max: 1000 }).escape(),
  body('email').isEmail().normalizeEmail(),
], (req, res) => {
  const errors = validationResult(req);
  if (!errors.isEmpty()) {
    return res.status(400).json({ errors: errors.array() });
  }
  // Process validated input
});

// ‚ùå Bad: No input validation
router.post('/reviews', (req, res) => {
  const { rating, comment, email } = req.body; // Unsafe!
  // Direct use without validation
});
```

#### Authentication Checks
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Check authentication and authorization
router.get('/admin/stats', auth, requireRole('admin'), (req, res) => {
  // Protected endpoint
});

// ‚ùå Bad: No authentication check
router.get('/admin/stats', (req, res) => {
  // Unprotected sensitive endpoint
});
```

#### Secure Database Queries
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Use parameterized queries with Prisma
const reviews = await prisma.review.findMany({
  where: {
    status: status, // Prisma handles sanitization
    rating: {
      gte: minRating
    }
  }
});

// ‚ùå Bad: Raw SQL queries (potential SQL injection)
const reviews = await prisma.$queryRaw`
  SELECT * FROM reviews WHERE status = ${status}
`; // Don't do this!
```

#### Error Handling
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Safe error handling
try {
  const result = await dangerousOperation();
  res.json({ success: true, data: result });
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Operation failed', { error: error.message, userId: req.user.id });
  res.status(500).json({ 
    error: 'Internal server error',
    // Don't expose sensitive error details in production
    ...(process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && { details: error.message })
  });
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Exposing sensitive information
catch (error) {
  res.status(500).json({ error: error.stack }); // Exposes stack trace!
}
```

### Environment Security

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# ‚úÖ Good: Use strong, unique secrets
JWT_SECRET=very-long-random-secret-key-that-is-hard-to-guess-123456789
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:strong-password@localhost:5432/db

# ‚ùå Bad: Weak or default secrets
JWT_SECRET=secret
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://admin:password@localhost:5432/db
```

#### Docker Security
```dockerfile
# ‚úÖ Good: Security-focused Dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS base

# Create non-root user
RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
RUN adduser -S backend -u 1001

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production && npm cache clean --force

# Copy application code
COPY --chown=backend:nodejs . .

# Switch to non-root user
USER backend

# Use specific port
EXPOSE 3001

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=10s --start-period=5s --retries=3 \
  CMD curl -f http://localhost:3001/api/health || exit 1

CMD ["node", "dist/server.js"]
```

### Frontend Security

#### XSS Prevention
```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good: Safe rendering
import { sanitize } from 'dompurify';

function ReviewComment({ comment }: { comment: string }) {
  return (
    <div 
      dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ 
        __html: sanitize(comment) // Sanitize user input
      }} 
    />
  );
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Direct HTML injection
function ReviewComment({ comment }: { comment: string }) {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: comment }} />; // XSS risk!
}
```

#### API Security
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Secure API calls
const apiCall = async (endpoint: string, options: RequestInit = {}) => {
  const token = getAuthToken();
  
  return fetch(`${API_BASE_URL}${endpoint}`, {
    ...options,
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'X-Requested-With': 'XMLHttpRequest', // CSRF protection
      ...options.headers,
    },
    credentials: 'same-origin', // CSRF protection
  });
};
```
