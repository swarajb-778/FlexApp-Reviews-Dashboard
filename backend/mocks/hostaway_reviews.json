The space was immaculately clean, modern, and had everything we needed for our week-long stay. The host was incredibly responsive and provided great local recommendations. The bed was comfortable, WiFi was fast, and the kitchen was well-equipped. We especially loved the balcony view overlooking the bustling street life. Would definitely book again!",
